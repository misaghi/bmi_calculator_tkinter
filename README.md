# bmi_calculator_tkinter

This is another small project in pure python. GUI also created using tkinter.
There are still some works can be done e.g. saving data using sqlite instead of text or add an option to show the history of calculations.

There is a problem with my BMI scale. It is not that accurate and also cannot display BMI < 1 correctly. So let me know if there is any fixes or ideas.
